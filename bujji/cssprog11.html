			Underscore consists of a little more than 100 functions, which fall under four main categories depending on the datatypes which they manipulate: functions for manipulating arrays, functions for manipulating objects, functions for manipulating both arrays and objects (the name of the category is "Collections") and functions for manipulating other functions. There are also two utility categories : "Utility" and "Chaining".
